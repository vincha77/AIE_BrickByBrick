# AIE_BrickByBrick

In this repo, I will "Build, Ship and Share" my learnings as I go through the AI Engineering Bootcamp Cohort #4.

As I write this, we are in the middle of week-5 of the 10-ten-week course offered by the wonderful folks at AI Makerspace!!  And, we have already covered a lot of ground in the course.  As someone from an earlier bootcamp mentioned, this definitely feels like "drinking from a firehose"!!

So, I decided to take a brief detour to experiment with some of the questions I've had over the past few weeks and 
save what I have learned as a useful reference for primarily for myself and for anyone else who might be interested.
