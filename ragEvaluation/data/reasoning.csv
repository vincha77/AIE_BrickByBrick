29,What was McCain's position on the ACA vote?,"John McCain's position on the ACA vote was to oppose the effort to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, as he walked onto the Senate floor and said no to the repeal, stating that there was no plan to replace it.","[""I will never forget the early morning hours when it was up for a vote in the United States Senate and the late great John McCain, who you have disparaged as being â€“ uh, you don't like him, you said at the time because he got caught, he was an American hero. The late great John McCain, I will never forget that night. Walked onto the Senate floor and said no, you don't. No, you don't. No, you don't get rid of the Affordable Care Act. You have no plan. And what the Affordable Care Act has done is eliminate the ability of insurance companies to deny people with pre-existing conditions. I don't have to tell the people watching tonight, you remember what that was like? Remember when an insurance company could deny if a child had asthma, if someone was a breast cancer survivor, if a grandparent had diabetes? And thankfully, as I've been vice president and we over the last four years have strengthened the Affordable Care Act, we have allowed for the first time Medicare to negotiate drug""]"
30,How do alliances influence U.S. support for global norms?,"The context discusses how alliances influence U.S. support for global norms by emphasizing the importance of standing up for friends and not favoring enemies. It highlights that America's role as a leader is dependent on its ability to uphold international rules and norms, which is supported by the alliances formed with other countries to collectively support Ukraine in its defense.","[""VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Yet again, I said it at the beginning of this debate, you're going to hear a bunch of lies coming from this fella. And that is another one. When I went to meet with President Zelenskyy, I've now met with him over five times. The reality is, it has been about standing as America always should, as a leader upholding international rules and norms. As a leader who shows strength, understanding that the alliances we have around the world are dependent on our ability to look out for our friends and not favor our enemies because you adore strongmen instead of caring about democracy. And that is very much what is at stake here. The President of the United States is commander-in-chief. And the American people have a right to rely on a president who understands the significance of America's role and responsibility in terms of ensuring that there is stability and ensuring we stand up for our principles and not sell them for the benefit of personal flattery."", ""VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, first of all, it's important to remind the former president you're not running against Joe Biden, you're running against me. I believe the reason that Donald Trump says that this war would be over within 24 hours is because he would just give it up. And that's not who we are as Americans. Let's understand what happened here. I actually met with Zelenskyy a few days before Russia invaded, tried through force to change territorial boundaries to defy one of the most important international rules and norms, which is the importance of sovereignty and territorial integrity. And I met with President Zelenskyy. I shared with him American intelligence about how he could defend himself. Days later I went to NATO's eastern flank, to Poland and Romania. And through the work that I and others did we brought 50 countries together to support Ukraine in its righteous defense. And because of our support, because of the air defense, the ammunition, the artillery, the""]"
31,How did Trump's Court picks impact state abortion bans?,"Trump's hand-selected members of the United States Supreme Court were intended to undo the protections of Roe v. Wade, which they accomplished, leading to the implementation of Trump abortion bans in over 20 states that criminalize healthcare provision by doctors and nurses, with no exceptions even for rape and incest.","[""VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, as I said, you're going to hear a bunch of lies. And that's not actually a surprising fact. Let's understand how we got here. Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. And they did exactly as he intended. And now in over 20 states there are Trump abortion bans which make it criminal for a doctor or nurse to provide health care. In one state it provides prison for life. Trump abortion bans that make no exception even for rape and incest. Which understand what that means. A survivor of a crime, a violation to their body, does not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body next. That is immoral. And one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government, and Donald Trump certainly, should not be telling a woman what to do with her body.""]"
32,What was Trump's approach to the Taliban for lowering soldier casualties?,"Trump's approach to the Taliban for lowering soldier casualties involved direct involvement and negotiation. He communicated with Abdul, the head of the Taliban, warning him to stop the killings of soldiers, which led to a period of 18 months with no American soldiers killed. This was part of a broader agreement negotiated by Mike Pompeo, which aimed at a withdrawal from Afghanistan without losing soldiers or leaving Americans behind.","[""FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, thank you. So if you take a look at that period of time, the Taliban was killing our soldiers, a lot of them, with snipers. And I got involved with the Taliban because the Taliban was doing the killing. That's the fighting force within Afghanistan. They don't bother doing that because you know, they deal with the wrong people all the time. But I got involved. And Abdul is the head of the Taliban. He is still the head of the Taliban. And I told Abdul don't do it anymore, you do it anymore you're going to have problems. And he said why do you send me a picture of my house? I said you're going to have to figure that out, Abdul. And for 18 months we had nobody killed. We did have an agreement negotiated by Mike Pompeo. It was a very good agreement. The reason it was good, it was -- we were getting out. We would have been out faster than them, but we wouldn't have lost the soldiers. We wouldn't have left many Americans behind. And we wouldn't have left""]"
33,What do red and blue state votes say about views on women's autonomy?,"The votes in both red and blue states indicate that the majority of Americans believe in a woman's right to make decisions about her own body, as evidenced by the fact that in every state where this issue has been on the ballot, the people have voted for freedom.","[""not -- the majority of Americans believe in a woman's right to make decisions about her own body. And that is why in every state where this issue has been on the ballot, in red and blue states both, the people of America have voted for freedom.""]"
34,What's Kamala Harris's view on fracking in relation to energy diversity?,"Kamala Harris's view on fracking is that she will not ban it and has not banned it as Vice President. She emphasizes the importance of investing in diverse sources of energy to reduce reliance on foreign oil, and she supports fracking as part of this approach.","[""VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: So my values have not changed. And I'm going to discuss every one -- at least every point that you've made. But in particular, let's talk about fracking because we're here in Pennsylvania. I made that very clear in 2020. I will not ban fracking. I have not banned fracking as Vice President of the United States. And, in fact, I was the tie-breaking vote on the Inflation Reduction Act, which opened new leases for fracking. My position is that we have got to invest in diverse sources of energy so we reduce our reliance on foreign oil. We have had the largest increase in domestic oil production in history because of an approach that recognizes that we cannot over rely on foreign oil. As it relates to my values, let me tell you, I grew up a middle-class kid raised by a hard-working mother who worked and saved and was able to buy our first home when I was a teenager. The values I bring to the importance of home ownership knowing not everybody got handed $400""]"
35,"What plans did Trump link to Harris on police, guns, and fracking?","President Trump linked several plans to Vice President Harris, stating that she has a plan to defund the police, confiscate everybody's gun, and not allow fracking in Pennsylvania or anywhere else.","[""DAVID MUIR: Vice President Harris, thank you.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: We have to move on. President trump --\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: She is destroying our country. She has a plan to defund the police. She has a plan to confiscate everybody's gun. She has a plan to not allow fracking in Pennsylvania or anywhere else. That's what her plan is until just recently.\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: President Trump, President Trump.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: The former president has said something twice and I need to respond too. I just need to respond one time to what he has said multiple times.""]"
36,What recent actions of Trump clash with his past views on abortion?,"Recent actions of President Trump that clash with his past views on abortion include his initial statement that a six-week abortion ban was too short, followed by his reversal where he stated he would vote to support the six-week ban. This change in position has led to skepticism from Vice President Harris, who argues that women shouldn't trust him on the issue due to his inconsistent stance.","['DAVID MUIR: President Trump, thank you. Linsey?\n\nLINSEY DAVIS: I want to turn to the issue of abortion. President Trump, you\'ve often touted that you were able to kill Roe v. Wade. Last year, you said that you were proud to be the most pro-life president in American history. Then last month you said that your administration would be great for women and their reproductive rights. In your home state of Florida, you surprised many with regard to your six-week abortion ban because you initially had said that it was too short and you said, ""I\'m going to be voting that we need more than six weeks."" But then the very next day, you reversed course and said you would vote to support the six-week ban. Vice President Harris says that women shouldn\'t trust you on the issue of abortion because you\'ve changed your position so many times. Therefore, why should they trust you?']"
37,What's the fraction of his dad's wealth Trump said he turned into billions?,The answer to given question is not present in context,"[""LINSEY DAVIS: President Trump, your response.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, first of all, I wasn't given $400 million. I wish I was. My father was a Brooklyn builder. Brooklyn, Queens. And a great father and I learned a lot from him. But I was given a fraction of that, a tiny fraction, and I built it into many, many billions of dollars. Many, many billions. And when people see it, they are even surprised. So, we don't have to talk about that. Fracking? She's been against it for 12 years. Uh, defund the police. She's been against that forever. She gave all that stuff up, very wrongly, very horribly. And everybody's laughing at it, okay? They're all laughing at it. She gave up at least 12 and probably 14 or 15 different policies. Like, she was big on defund the police.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: That's not true. [mouthed, not audible]""]"
38,How is military aid linked to Ukraine's defense against Putin?,"Military aid is linked to Ukraine's defense against Putin as it has provided essential support, including air defense, ammunition, artillery, javelins, and Abrams tanks, which have helped Ukraine maintain its independence and resist aggression.","[""the work that I and others did we brought 50 countries together to support Ukraine in its righteous defense. And because of our support, because of the air defense, the ammunition, the artillery, the javelins, the Abrams tanks that we have provided, Ukraine stands as an independent and free country. If Donald Trump were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now. And understand what that would mean. Because Putin's agenda is not just about Ukraine. Understand why the European allies and our NATO allies are so thankful that you are no longer president and that we understand the importance of the greatest military alliance the world has ever known, which is NATO. And what we have done to preserve the ability of Zelenskyy and the Ukrainians to fight for their Independence. Otherwise, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe. Starting with Poland. And why don't you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up""]"

Protecting seniors from scams. My values have not changed. And what is important is that there is a president who actually brings values and a perspective that is about lifting people up and not beating people down and name-calling. The true measure of the leader is the leader who actually understands that strength is not in beating people down, it's in lifting people up. I intend to be that president.""]"
40,"What links exist among extreme weather, insurance, and clean energy?","The context discusses the impact of extreme weather on individuals, particularly in relation to home insurance, where people are either denied coverage or face increased costs. It also mentions investments in clean energy as a solution to address climate change, which is linked to the occurrence of extreme weather. Therefore, the link among extreme weather, insurance, and clean energy is that extreme weather events can affect insurance availability and costs, while investments in clean energy aim to mitigate the effects of climate change that contribute to such extreme weather.","[""VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, the former president had said that climate change is a hoax. And what we know is that it is very real. You ask anyone who lives in a state who has experienced these extreme weather occurrences who now is either being denied home insurance or is being jacked up. You ask anybody who has been the victim of what that means in terms of losing their home, having nowhere to go. We know that we can actually deal with this issue. The young people of America care deeply about this issue. And I am proud that as vice president over the last four years, we have invested a trillion dollars in a clean energy economy while we have also increased domestic gas production to historic levels. We have created over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs while I have been vice president. We have invested in clean energy to the point that we are opening up factories around the world. Donald Trump said he was going to create manufacturing jobs. He lost manufacturing jobs. And I'm""]"
41,What's Trump's take on firing officials and its link to the economy/inflation?,"Trump believes that when someone does a bad job, they should be fired, and he criticizes others for not firing officials who have performed poorly, particularly in relation to Afghanistan and the economy. He points out that the current administration has not fired any of their economists despite issues like inflation, implying that accountability is necessary for effective governance.","[""FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. Thank you. Because when I hear that -- see, I'm a different kind of a person. I fired most of those people. Not so graciously. They did bad things or a bad job. I fired them. They never fired one person. They didn't fire anybody having to do with Afghanistan and the Taliban and the 13 people whose, whose, were just killed viciously and violently killed and I got to know the parents and the family. They should have fired all those generals, all those top people because that was one of the most incompetently handled situations anybody has ever seen. So when somebody does a bad job I fire them. And you take a guy like Esper. He was no good, I fired him. So he writes a book. Another one writes a book. Because with me they can write books. With nobody else can they. But they have done such a poor job. And they never fire anybody. Look at the economy. Look at the inflation. They didn't fire any of their economists. They have the same people. That's a""]"
42,What was Trump's stance on late-term abortion and newborn decisions?,"Trump's stance on late-term abortion is that he opposes it, stating that there are instances where decisions about the baby will be made after birth, implying a severe consequence such as execution.","[""FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, the reason I'm doing that vote is because the plan is, as you know, the vote is, they have abortion in the ninth month. They even have, and you can look at the governor of West Virginia, the previous governor of West Virginia, not the current governor, who's doing an excellent job, but the governor before. He said the baby will be born and we will decide what to do with the baby. In other words, we'll execute the baby.""]"

44,What priorities does Harris highlight for U.S.-China competitiveness in trade and tech?,"Kamala Harris highlights several priorities for U.S.-China competitiveness in trade and technology, including focusing on relationships with allies, investing in American-based technology, winning the race in A.I. and quantum computing, and supporting America's workforce to ensure workers' rights are protected.","[""VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, let's be clear that the Trump administration resulted in a trade deficit, one of the highest we've ever seen in the history of America. He invited trade wars, you wanna talk about his deal with China what he ended up doing is under Donald Trump's presidency he ended up selling American chips to China to help them improve and modernize their military basically sold us out when a policy about China should be in making sure the United States of America wins the competition for the 21st century. Which means focusing on the details of what that requires, focusing on relationships with our allies, focusing on investing in American based technology so that we win the race on A.I. and quantum computing, focusing on what we need to do to support America's workforce, so that we don't end up having the on the short end of the stick in terms of workers' rights.

Since I've been vice president we have capped the cost of prescription medication for seniors at $2,000 a year. And when I am president we will do that for all people understanding that the value I bring to this is that access to health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it.
